# vehicle_speed_detection
Vehicle Speed detection using opencv and dlib

# Running the Program:
To run the code given above, you need to follow these steps:
1.	Install the required libraries: OpenCV and dlib. You can install them using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
 
2.	Download the car detection classifier file "cars.xml" from this link: https://github.com/andrewssobral/vehicle_detection_haarcascades/blob/master/cars.xml and save it in the same directory as the code.
3.	Open your Python IDE (such as PyCharm, Spyder, or IDLE) and create a new Python file.
4.	Copy and paste the code given above into your Python file.

5.	Replace the value of video in line 10 with the path to your input video file. For example, if your video file is named "input.mp4" and is located in the same directory as the code, then you can replace video = cv2.VideoCapture(0) with video = cv2.VideoCapture('input.mp4').
6.	Run the code and you should see a window displaying the output video with car detection and tracking. You can exit the window by pressing the "Esc" key.
Note: Make sure your computer has a webcam or the input video file is located in the specified path, and the video dimensions (WIDTH and HEIGHT) in the code match the dimensions of your input video.

# Requirements
To run the code, you will need:
1.	Python 3.x installed on your system
2.	OpenCV library for Python installed on your system
3.	Dlib library for Python installed on your system
4.	A video file to use as input for the program.
You can install OpenCV and Dlib libraries using pip. To install OpenCV, you can run the following command:
 
To install Dlib, you can run the following command:
 
Once you have installed the necessary libraries, you can run the code in a Python IDE or using the command line.
